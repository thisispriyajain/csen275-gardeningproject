## Key Domain Rules

1. **Plant Lifecycle Rule**: Plants must progress through growth stages sequentially
2. **Water Conservation Rule**: Watering only occurs when moisture < threshold
3. **Temperature Range Rule**: Plants suffer damage outside tolerance range
4. **Pest Threshold Rule**: Treatment activates only at high infestation levels
5. **Zone Integrity Rule**: Each cell belongs to exactly one zone
6. **Time Progression Rule**: All updates occur on simulation tick
7. **Resource Depletion Rule**: Systems stop when supplies (water, pesticide) are exhausted
8. **Health Decay Rule**: Plant health decreases when conditions are suboptimal
9. **Weather Effect Rule**: Weather modifies growth rates and resource needs
10. **Logging Rule**: All significant events must be logged with timestamp
