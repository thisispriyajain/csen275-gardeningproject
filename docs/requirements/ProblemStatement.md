# Problem Statement

## Context

Modern gardening faces several challenges including water waste, pest damage, temperature fluctuations, and the time-intensive nature of manual garden management. Home gardeners and agricultural operations need automated systems to optimize plant health while minimizing resource consumption and labor.

## Problem

**Primary Issue:** Manual garden management is inefficient, leading to:
- Over-watering or under-watering of plants
- Delayed response to pest infestations
- Suboptimal temperature conditions
- Inconsistent plant care
- Resource waste (water, fertilizer, energy)
- High maintenance time requirements

**Secondary Issues:**
- Lack of real-time monitoring and alerts
- Difficulty tracking plant health over time
- No centralized control system
- Poor coordination between different subsystems

## Stakeholders

1. **Home Gardeners**: Need simple, automated garden management
2. **Agricultural Students**: Require educational simulation tools
3. **System Administrators**: Manage and configure the automation systems
4. **Garden Managers**: Monitor multiple garden zones simultaneously

## Proposed Solution

A **Computerized Garden Simulation System** that:
- Automates watering based on soil moisture and plant needs
- Monitors and controls temperature conditions
- Detects and responds to pest infestations
- Provides real-time visualization of garden state
- Logs all events for analysis
- Simulates growth patterns and environmental factors

## Success Criteria

1. System runs continuously for 24+ hours without crashes
2. Plants receive appropriate care based on their specific needs
3. All subsystems coordinate effectively
4. Comprehensive logging of all events
5. Intuitive user interface for monitoring and control
6. Realistic simulation of plant growth and environmental factors

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- Garden grid simulation (9x9 or similar)
- Multiple plant types with different requirements
- Watering system with zones and sensors
- Heating/cooling system with temperature control
- Pest control with detection and treatment
- Real-time UI with color-coded status
- Event logging system
- Manual override capabilities

**Out of Scope:**
- Physical hardware integration
- Machine learning predictions
- Mobile applications
- Multi-user authentication
- Cloud synchronization
- Real-world sensor data integration
